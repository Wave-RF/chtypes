# Known limitations

Every item here is a deliberate decline or a stated boundary, not a bug queue. The rule underneath all of them is the same one: **chtypes refuses to guess.** An answer it is not certain of is worth less than an honest `unsupported`, because a wrong answer about types is the failure the product exists to prevent.

When you get one, fall back to the server: validate cautiously, forward the row unpreviewed, and never tell a user they are wrong on the strength of a decline.

## macOS is a development floor, not an oracle

The darwin artifacts exist so you can develop and run the suites on a laptop. They are not an oracle.

macOS's `long double` is 53-bit, so some float parses diverge from a real server. Measured: on Linux the float corpus matches in full; on macOS none of it does. That is not a near miss to be tolerated — it is a systematic difference in a whole class of values.

**Float expectations must come from a Linux artifact or a live ClickHouse.** Everything else on a Mac is trustworthy for development.

## EPHEMERAL columns cannot be previewed through a format stream

An INSERT whose explicit column list names an EPHEMERAL column cannot be previewed here, because a format stream carries no column list. There is no way to tell, from the body alone, that the caller meant the ephemeral form.

Detect the intersection at compile time and decline it rather than mispreview:

|            |                                                          |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Go         | `schema.Columns`, `DefaultKind == chtypes.KindEphemeral` |
| Python     | `schema.columns`, `DefaultKind.EPHEMERAL`                |
| TypeScript | `schema.columns`, `defaultKind === 'EPHEMERAL'`          |
| Rust       | `schema.columns()`, `DefaultKind::Ephemeral`             |

A gateway that previews the intersection anyway shows a row that cannot exist.

## Declined by design

Each of these is `unsupported` — an `UnsupportedError`, `Error::Unsupported`, or the `unsupported` outcome. None of them is a rejection, and none is a defect.

- **Engines and sorting keys** beyond the modeled MergeTree family.
- **TTL forms** that are not a plain rows TTL: `WHERE` and `GROUP BY` TTLs, `TO DISK` and `TO VOLUME` moves, `RECOMPRESS`, and any clock-reading TTL expression.
- **MergeTree settings declared at a non-default value.** An unknown _name_ is the server's own 115, a rejection; a known name at a value this build does not model is a decline, never a silent ignore.
- **Server- and session-property DEFAULTs** — `hostName()`, `currentUser()` and the rest. Their value is a property of the server, and there is no server here.
- **Blocking DEFAULTs**, such as anything calling `sleep`.
- **DEFAULT expressions past the admission budgets** — 256 MiB and one second by default, both adjustable through the process-wide settings in [`guides/settings.md`](guides/settings.md).

## Constants are not payloads

Everything on the row path is **insert-side** coercion. Never reuse it to fold a `WHERE`-clause constant.

The rules genuinely differ: `256` into a `UInt8` column stores `0`, while `x = 256` over that column promotes and is false for every row. Refuse an operand outside the column type's domain instead — or use [`guides/filters.md`](guides/filters.md), which is the surface that answers comparison questions with ClickHouse's own comparison functions.

## Filters are shadow-only for now

No read-side security may be enforced on the filter surface until the WHERE-truth rig gates green. Until then it is for shadow and replay: run it beside your existing enforcement and compare, do not replace.

The parse-once block twin does not change that — it is a performance shape, not a maturity signal, and sits under the same gate.

## Binary formats depend on the artifact, not the binding

`RowBinary` and its family, `Native` and `Buffers` parse only on artifacts new enough to carry the reader. This is a property of the **loaded artifact's age**, not of your binding's version, so probe the artifact rather than assuming from the package version. Earlier artifacts answer 73 or 117 exactly as their own servers do.

## The error model is normative

`unsupported` (`CODE_UNSUPPORTED`, the wire sentinel `-2`) is neither an acceptance nor a rejection, and treating it as either is the most expensive mistake available here.

Both over-accepts and over-rejects are **budgeted at zero** in the proof behind the artifacts: a row accepted here and rejected by the server ships before the insert fails, and a row rejected here and accepted by the server is silent data loss. A decline is how the system stays honest about the cases it cannot reach that bar on.

In Python specifically, `UnsupportedError` is a **peer** of `SchemaError` rather than a subclass, so `except SchemaError` never catches a decline. Handle the two arms explicitly, or catch `ChtypesError` for both. The subtype was retired precisely because catching one and getting the other is a silent misclassification.

The ABI header is the full contract.

## Pre-1.0

The ABI is frozen at revision 4 and all four bindings pin that number at compile time. Package names, the artifact name `libchtypes`, the `chs_` prefix and the `enum chs_format` numbers are frozen; function signatures froze at the first tag.

Anything else may still move before 1.0. Each binding's own CHANGELOG carries its list.
